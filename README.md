# Project: Recommendation-Engine
## by Shivam Chauhan

## Description
In this project I have created different recommendation engine using similarity, collaborative filtering, content based filtering and mixed factorization. 

## Installation
These notebooks runs on anaconda environment and the requirements of this environment can be installed using the file “requiremnt.txt”

## Dataset Overview

> Data Was downloaded from MovieTweetings Data.
>- movies - a dataframe of all of the movies in the dataset along with other content related information about the movies (genre and date)
>- reviews - this was the main dataframe used before for collaborative filtering, as it contains all of the interactions between users and movies.
>- all_recs - a dictionary where each key is a user, and the value is a list of movie recommendations based on collaborative filtering
